==============

C++ solutions for the problems presented in Cracking The Coding Interview (5th edition) book.

Each problems are named with p##_##.cpp convention.
Eg. p11.1.cpp (Chapter 11 problem 1)

There are additional helper files containing my own implementation of useful data structures.
These were designed just for learning purpose. As a result, they are surely lacking in any sort fo finese.
 - Linked List
 - Binary Tree
 - Graph Traversal Algorithm
